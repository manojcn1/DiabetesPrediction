Diabetes Predictive Analysis 📊
Problem Statement 🚩
Diabetes is a growing global health crisis, with millions of new diagnoses each year. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent complications, yet many individuals remain undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. This project aims to address the need for an efficient, scalable, and accessible means of predicting diabetes risk based on health metrics, potentially serving as a tool for early intervention and awareness.

Project Aim 🎯
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using various health indicators. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we seek to provide insights that could assist healthcare providers in identifying at-risk individuals, facilitating timely and preventive healthcare measures.

Project Overview
Through comprehensive data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing, we aim to identify significant predictors of diabetes. The core of the project is centered around the development of a Logistic Regression model, designed to classify individuals based on various health metrics.
